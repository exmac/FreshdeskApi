FAQ's
-----------

1. Why does it look like a WP Plugin part?

	This API was originally designed to allow customers to submit help tickets from the WP backend.
	Note that you can easily completely remove the WP functionality and just use the straight API.

2. What's left to be done?

	First off, there needs to be validation on the form fields. There isn't any right now.
	Second, there should be something that lets a user know that the form was submitted (like "Ticket submitted" or something).
	Third, the form fields should be translatable.
